1. Run the `install.sh` script file.
    This will install the latest version of [`Neovim`](https://neovim.io/) and [`Vim-Plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
    This will also install all plugins and update any existing nvim settings to this configuration.
    ```bash
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bossley9/nvim-config/master/install.sh | bash 
    ```
    If future updates are made to this nvim configuration, rerun this script to pull the latest updates and install them automatically.

3. Run `nvim` to open any file. Enjoy!

## About <a name="about"></a>
I have been using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the past few years and I've enjoyed many of its features and extensions. However, it takes a large toll on memory ([and telemetry is creepy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40451596/visual-studio-code-still-accessing-internet-after-update-and-telemetry-was-disab)).

Neovim, on the other hand, focuses solely on what it was made to do - edit files.

This configuration of nvim is something I use in order to improve my speed and efficiency while editing code projects.
